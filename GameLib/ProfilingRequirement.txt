    Add a Profiling system to your game. It should allow for:
        The ability to time a section of code or function using the high resolution CPU timer. You should already have code to do this for your frame timer.
        The ability to accumulate these timings over time, keeping track of the sum, counts and min and max.
        The ability to print out the accumated information.
        The ability to turn accumulation on and off.
    Add a keypress message handler that, when a given key is pressed:
        Starts accumulating if we're not currently accumulating timings.
        Stops accumulating if we're currently accumulating.
        Prints out the timing information we have.
    Include the ability to time a function or section of code using simple preprocessor macros, as we discussed in class.
    Include the ability to completely enable or disable your timing code based on a preprocessor define.
    Add a new build configuration to your solution that is based on a full release build but enables profiling.
    Add enough timers to your code to time all the code in your Collision system.
