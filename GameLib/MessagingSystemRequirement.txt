    Add a messaging system to your game.
        It should include a function callback or base interface class for message receiving that allows the user to receive notification of a particular message.
        It should support sending of a message (event notification) and data associated with the message, if necessary.
        It should support using the same callback for multiple messages.
        Add one other feature to your messaging system (such as the ability to prioritize receivers for a particular message).
    Use your messaging system for notifying of key presses.
        Make your engine receive the keyboard callback from Cheesy and have it send messages of key presses.
    Add sending of a "Player Died" message.
        Have at least one receiver of the "Player Died" message.
